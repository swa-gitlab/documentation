18:25 < bguery> hi
19:05 < knix> After upgrading to 5.1 new keys are not being added to gitlab-shell
21:28 < knix> nevermind, sidekick wasn't running ;)
16:03 < chronos> I have a server with gitolite installed and working also. Wanna try gitlab, but if it now works, there is way to uninstall gitlab and keep gitolite?
17:05 < universa1> chronos: just back up the gitolites user directory
17:05 < universa1> chronos: and restore that if you're unhappy
19:59 < chronos> thx universa1!
20:52 < melder> does anyone else get an error when running annotate?
20:55 < notwen> what error?
20:56 < melder>  /local/gitme/gitlab/app/controllers/omniauth_callbacks_controller.rb:2:in `<class:OmniauthCallbacksController>': undefined method `config' for Gitlab:Module (NoMethodError)
20:56 < melder> trying this on 5-1-stable
21:04 < notwen> wonder if that's because they've started to use gitlab_config
05:15 < dsup> Hi
05:15 < dsup> Any idea what is causing this error? https://ezcrypt.it/6s6n#3NfHcXM01ayjUezgAyk0IvKE
05:15 < dsup> gitlab will not start, running 5.0
