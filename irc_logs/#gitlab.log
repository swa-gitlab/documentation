20:08 < mcfoobar> Hi! Im trying to run gitlab under a sub uri with apache. I finally got it work. BUT: Some asset urls (not all)  are wrong. And even worse: the repositories can no longer be accessed, they 404.  Any ideas? I've been trying to get this working for hours.
20:15 < dblessing> mcfoobar: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/gitlabhq/mPcpq85VHew/4qupsUY90oEJ maybe that will help

20:22 < mcfoobar> dblessing: thanks for your help. sadly, that does not change anything
20:23 < dblessing> mcfoobar: ok. can you create a new vhost and proxy directly through?
20:24 < mcfoobar> dblessing: you mean withouth passenger?
20:24 < dblessing> no i mean serve it up at / instead of another context
20:25 < mcfoobar> ah okay, yes I could do that, and that works. But I want to run it at /gitlab

21:09 < manacit> I installed gitlab via turnkey (embarrassing, I know, but it's the easiest way to get it going on AWS) - I'm just wondering what the best way to get an automated backup system is? I keep getting "Don't know how to build task 'gitlab:backup:create" - any tips. I'm probably doing it wrong!
21:11 < dblessing> manacit: i haven't explored the backup rake task yet but we just backup the database and the repositories directory and call it good
21:12 < manacit> do you back up the actual /home/git/, or the individual repos? 
21:12 < manacit> pardon the questions, just want to get it right

22:17 < FFForever> manacit, Still having trouble?
22:18 < manacit> I can't get gitlab:backup:create to run
22:18 < manacit> I was thinking of just backing up /home/git and the mysqldb, but I like the idea of using the built in solution!
22:19 < FFForever> Is there a backup task? I've croned postgres dump & tar zipped on a nightly basis for backups
22:20 < manacit> there's supposed to be yeah
22:21 < FFForever> How are you running it? RAILS_ENV=production rake gitlab:backup:create?
22:21 < FFForever> I just found it.. I normally only use gitlab:check hehe
22:21 < manacit> https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/raketasks/backup_restore.md
22:21 < manacit> bundle exec rake gitlab:backup:create RAILS_ENV=production
22:22 < FFForever> SHould work. Are you running master or stable?
22:22 < manacit> I believe stable - I just grabbed the AMI on AWS
22:22 < manacit> which is stable - 12.0 
22:23 < FFForever> there is no 12.0....
22:23 < manacit> oh well
22:24 < manacit> that's the ami version number
22:24 < manacit> 2.2-11 (upstream archive)
22:24  * FFForever doesn't use aws.
22:24 < FFForever> Gitlab is currently on 5.x
22:24 < manacit> a micro instance is free
22:24 < manacit> yeah I realized how old that is when I checked
22:24 < manacit> damn
22:25 < manacit> well in that case, never mind, I'll install it myself
22:25  * manacit mumbles something stupid about aws and ami and turnkey
22:30 < FFForever> A micro instance is only free for 12 months :P
22:38 < manacit> aww gitlab doesn't want to run on only 512mb of ram 
22:38 < manacit> :(
22:44 < FFForever> 512mb of ram is very little for a rails app.....
23:21 < giany> anyone using a flow like dev-stage-prod? any hints regarding how can i accomplish this?
23:32 < dblessing> giany: with regard to what? code flow? 
23:32 < dblessing> we use feature branches for dev, develop branch for stage-ish servers, and deploy from tags for prod
23:42 -!- trompette [~bob@punch.chezmerlet.net] has left #gitlab []
23:44 < giany> i'm interested in code flow
23:45 < giany> basically now I have one repo, I can commit to it and push to origin
23:45 < giany> this repo will be the dev one
23:45 < giany> not sure how can i move a commit to stage/prod..
23:45 < giany> any documentation regarding this?
23:48 < dblessing> giany: i think that's just a git workflow issue instead of a gitlab one
23:49 < dblessing> you probably don't need to move anything so to speakâ€¦rather just tag or use branches or do something else within the same repo.  that's kind of the point of git
23:50 < dblessing> it's not necessary to have separate repos for dev/stage/prod.  unless you really, really want to.
23:55 < dblessing> idk if this will help or cause confusion, but git it a look anyway - http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

04:56 < manacit> speaking as someone who is unfamiliar with gitlab, is " Failed to create satellite for Administrator / Project" an error I should be particularly concerned about
05:07 < manacit> I ran sudo -u gitlab -H bundle exec rake gitlab:satellites:create RAILS_ENV=production and it seemed to work!
05:12 < geck> manacit: ah-hah
05:12 < geck> thanks
05:12 < geck> I've been hitting that with some of my stuff on miport repos
05:12 < geck> imported repos
05:12 < manacit> I had to make a directory
05:13 < manacit> sudo -u gitlab -H mkdir /home/gitlab/gitlab-satellites
05:13 < manacit> the installer doesn't make it by default
05:14 < geck> mm
05:14 < geck> ya, you have to do that by hand
05:14 < geck> that may not work for me then
05:14 < geck> I have 24 repos that work just fine
05:14 < geck> thena  couple that I imported after the 5.0 -> 5.1 update
05:14 < geck> that just don't work quite right
07:50 < manacit> has anyone gone 4.0 -> 5.0
07:50 < manacit> or should I just reinstall and go with 5.0
07:53 < manacit> meh I might just go with bitnami !

15:20 < LndGoncalves> Guys, how do I authenticate User via password? and not just the key.
15:20 < dblessing> LndGoncalves: via api you mean? using internal auth or LDAP?
15:26 < LndGoncalves> umm no,
15:26 < LndGoncalves> for a simple "git push" is needed a password.
15:48 < LndGoncalves> dblessing, 
15:50 < LndGoncalves> I'm using the Simple Authentication gitlab
15:50 < LndGoncalves> but I can change if necessary.
15:50 < LndGoncalves> what I want, and to make any changes to a push type, the user must enter a password.
15:52 < dblessing> LndGoncalves: ah yes you must use a key.  no way around that

16:03 < bigjay> Hi
16:04 < LndGoncalves> hi
16:05 < bigjay> can i use gitlab without a webserver?
16:07 < bigjay> or to put it in other words:
16:07 < bigjay> i followed the installation guide at 
16:07 < bigjay> https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/doc/install/installation.md#advanced-setup-tips
16:08 < bigjay> to point 7
16:08 < bigjay> but i want to use apache2 
16:08 -!- kenperkins [~textual@50-47-18-37.evrt.wa.frontiernet.net] has joined #gitlab
16:09 < bigjay> can anyone point me to a working howto for gitlab 5.1?
16:15 < dblessing> bigjay: you can use apache, but you'll need something else with it.  you could do apache with passenger and run it that way, although i've never done it.  or you could still run gitlab on puma and just proxy through apache
16:16 < dblessing> bigjay: so instead of following nginx settings for number 7, just use standard apache configuration to connect to a unix socket. must like this post talks about http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5780886/proxy-apache-load-balancers-to-a-unix-socket-instead-of-a-port
16:17 < dblessing> bigjay: hmm never mind don't use that post.  bad example :) idk how to proxy with apache to a unix socket, or if it's possible.  alternatively, modify the puma config to run on a port instead of a socket. then you just use normal apache proxy pass 
16:17 < bigjay> how can i check if puma is accesible?
16:18 -!- mkrause [~mkrause@77.60.209.193] has quit [Quit: mkrause]
16:18 < bigjay> +s
16:18 < bigjay> in my gitlab.yml I specified a port 
16:19 < dblessing> if you follow the directions from gitlab, it will have puma create a socket.  but if you want to hit it directly at a port you need to modify $GITLAB_HOME/config/puma.rb and comment out the unix:/ socket and uncomment the port
16:19 < bigjay> after `/etc/service/gitlab start` shouldn't I be able to access gitlab on that port?
16:19 < dblessing> puma doesn't listen on a port by default, with gitlab's config anyway.  it creates a unix socket
16:20 < dblessing> you must edit puma.rb and exchange these two lines (uncomment one, comment the other)
16:20 < dblessing> https://gist.github.com/bke-drewb/5547728
16:20 < dblessing> reverse those...
16:22 < dblessing> make sense?
16:24 < bigjay> yep, and after i (re)start the gitlab service it print on the console:
16:24 < bigjay> * Listening on tcp://0.0.0.0:9292
16:24 < dblessing> awesome 
16:25 < bigjay> but 
16:25 < bigjay> lynx 0.0.0.0:9292
16:25 < bigjay> says it could not connect
16:25 < dblessing> well you can't do that :) 0.0.0.0 just means it's listening on all interfaces
16:26 < bigjay> so how do I connect?
16:26 < bigjay> localhost?
16:26 < dblessing> yep
16:26 < dblessing> or the box's IP address
16:26 < dblessing> new to linux? :)
16:26 < bigjay> LOL 
16:27 < bigjay> nope, but we got admins for that at work - i am trying it at home - hoping to get the other devs to switch from svn to git
16:28 < dblessing> ok haha
16:29 < bigjay> nope, still nothing
16:29 < bigjay> i am confused:
16:29 < bigjay> why is there a port option in config/gitlab.yml
16:30 < bigjay> what does it set?
16:30 < bigjay> (a port obviously - but ??? )
16:30 < dblessing> bigjay: i think it handles link creation and stuff like that for the web interface 
16:30 < dblessing> so if you're not running on port 80, it needs to know so it can construct links accordingly
16:31 < bigjay> ok, so this should be the same as in puma.yml ?
16:31 < bigjay> sorry, puma.rb

16:45 < dblessing> what do you mean it doesn't work?

20:25 < manacit> well, the text does, but javascript et all doesn't
20:40 < dblessing> manacit: according to what you said you're trying to move from /gitlab to /, so why do you set the relative root to /gitlab?
20:41 < manacit> Instead of /gitlab/? that sounds like a good idea! I tried moving it to / but that didn't work
20:41 < manacit> I freely admit to being new when it comes to ruby on rails / passenger, which is why I'm having this issue!
20:49 < dblessing> manacit: relative root would refer to where it's accessed via the web server.  so if you want to access at / then your relative root should be / also.  
20:49 < manacit> ah
20:50 < dblessing> but if that doesn't work then i'd have to take a look at  your configs. there's lots that could happen :) unfortunately

13:04 < bluenemo> tried to upgrade to 5 yesterday. had special characters in the wikis which broke my whole installation. had to roll back and now cant access any project via the web interface. when i click on one i get this project is empty thing (create / existent repository thing) gitlab:check works without a single error.
13:04 < bluenemo> i'm back to 3.0.3 now using gitolite 3
13:05 < bluenemo> + i dont get why such a serious bug (wiki migration broken) is not mentioned in the upgrade guide.. makes me a bit angry to be honest. 
13:06 < bluenemo> when i try to create a project i get GitLab was unable to access your Gitolite system (besides viewing existing projects doesnt work).

16:09 < handrus> Hi! Anyone knows about a source on how to migrate from bare gitolite to the new gitlab?
16:10 < handrus> I assume it would be just remove gitolite and import the existing repositories to gitlab... not sure
16:24 < bguery> handrus, I did by doing a fresh installation and used rake:migrate task for the db, I then add to manually fix authorized_keys to be sure to use gitlab-shell instead of gitolite
16:27 < handrus> got it bguery. I don't have gitlab, so I guess the rake:migrate is not needed
